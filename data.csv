Looking at research throughout the stages production, dissemination and UPTAKE the last often being forgotten or dropped (especially through funding mechanisms). We need to support research literacy among users and how to access and use research to improve and make reforms. rather than the constant production of research that goes no where or is not funded in a way that enables the researcher to build on and involve users in. ","Honestly I want to leave my profession. But I know the skills of research will be used in any future work I do. Whatever that is. ","My survey I am sure is not so helpful for you as I am not a researcher in the way you define it. But I would urge you to consider typologies of researchers for example those in consulting firms like KPMG and Deloite or people like me who have going into the international development world and accidentally found myself overseeing surveys of 5000 sample sizes and 80 FGDs and KIIs or conducting opinion polls for Gallup, and providing analysis to international governments on peace processes and conflict, writing 10-15k word reports in 3 month periods plus data collection. I have fallen into this with my highest education at being bachelors and many of my colleagues are have masters. So research careers can start at any point not only after doctorate degrees. While this may not be the focus of this study it may be worth exploring if support for research careers could be provided early to enable better connection between academic researchers and higher education and social and policy research space (again most of my career has been in Myanmar where this ecosystem is particularly strange since the 1960s Myanmar higher education has been weak especially in the social sciences so it is NGOs and international development that influences this space the most). I took this survey and have been following this work in iRELAND AS i am currently designing a programme of support for early career Myanmar researchers so will be interested to learn from your study and see if anything is applicable in other contexts.

My kids were small. The job was too demanding time wise and seemed to. be based on working 50+ hours a week which I couldn’t do with a young family so I felt that I was falling behind. I got ill with a huge cancer scare 1.5 years in (? Ovarian cancer) and hadmajor surgery and on return the work load had built up and was worse. The support was minimal and the levels of competition in the department were fierce. It never felt collegial. Women got all the menial and time consuming roles. Men got the high profile easier path and were championed for promotion. Communication was indirect and very cliquish. I loved teaching on the clinical doctorate and had done that as an occasional lecturer for 15 years and I had super reviews from trainees but it wasn’t enough to balance the stress of the role. Even small things like parking which staff couldn’t get, it was first-come first-served for all on campus but I had to drop kids to school so I had to then take the bus so everything took longer. It was before Covid so the expectation was always to be on campus. I was expected to supervise 2 doctoral theses in each of 3 years, so 6 at a time plus 2 master thesis and 6 undergrad projects, plus teach an UG module and do 10+ days on the clinical programme, plus do 10+ in person placement visits 4 times a year, plus several departmental admin roles. It was non-stop and never clear when I could take holidays. Management and mentors were largely absent. Everyone was too busy to be present or helpful. The gossiping and infighting was nasty. Happy out of it but still feel like I failed and feel very disappointed that it didn’t work out. I lost relationships that had been important to me for the previous 15 years. . ",Yes,Not now.

I previously worked in very male dominated areas, and especially during my PhD and Postdocs in Ireland, I felt very grateful and lucky (that word in itself is telling!) that I worked with men who considered me their equal. In comparison when I reflect on my experience in my undergraduate studies, I came across more unconscious bias from lecturers and other students. ","I am generally very happy with what I have achieved during my career, but the one organisation that really gave me the confidence and made me feel like I was an equal was during my time in Deloitte as a Management Consultant. The company supported a culture to drive equality in leadership (for example it was encouraged that both men and women were supported to take time out for caring responsibilities), and I felt that women leaders were respected as much as men across the whole organisation.   

However as I reflect on roles within academia and research now as a spectator, I think there are still large cultural barriers, and women are still not recognised sufficiently for their achievements.  

Career breaks for both men and women should be encouraged if they chose to take them, different career models should be implemented to allow people where they choose to take on demanding jobs for a few years (and get paid appropriately for it), and then be allowed to take a step back in the number of responsibilities so work load can be appropriately shared to support different life stages for example.",Neutral,Other (Specify Below),"To be honest I fell into research, I was struggling to find a job at the after graduating, and I signed up originally for a research masters so I could get 'paid' (my stipend) and also a qualification.

Also they have supported me in providing feedback on  applications/grants. Also providing guidance on how to achieve the career goals and engaging in goal setting to get there. ","Vague generic advice from career advisory services or just being told to go off and research something more (despite having done the research) - I have had some excellent career advisors who knew the field well - I actually think career advice I received at undergrad level when deciding whether to pursue the PhD was unhelpful and did not clarify the questions I had about this route. In hindsight - speaking to supervisors or PhD students would have been more helpful. ",Little influence,,Yes,"I think a realist awareness of the career path - I think i was under the illusion that once I had a PhD the world would be my oyster - I was not aware of the challenges of academia - the publish/get grant or perish -the limited salary particularly for early career - the limited full time positions available etc. I only came aware of this long into the PhD. I also think during the Phd it would have been helpful to be introduced to the career options outside academia -this was emphasised by career guidance in my postdocs and was helpful - but i was not aware of the other options and that also makes you scared to leave academia in a way. ","Career development,Careers outside academia,Publishing,Mentoring,Writing funding proposal,Writing job applications/covering letters/CVs,Job interviewing,Networking,Teaching",,"Short term contracts. Low pay. Feeling undervalued for the work you do. Timing of career progression with 'Life' - By the time you finish Phd/start postdoc route it is also likely the time when many want to settle down (i.e., buy a house, start family) - so timing is a challenge as academia does not reward or accomodate this (i.e. taking time away from work) nor does it sufficiently allow you stability/funding to buy a house etc","Accomplishment is developing resources that appear to benefit the users of these resources - very rewarding. Also 'finding my people' has been great - i.e., working with others who are passionate like I am and developing solutions together is exciting.","Pay increases for PhD students is a necessity! It is appalling that Phd stipends are below the minimum age. Similarly for postdocs - the salary is poor and stability is low. More opportunities for work are required - and not only through grants that take 3 months to write - and another year or so (if not more) to be awarded. Grant turnaround really needs to be quicker. Perhaps more grant opportunities for senior researchers to hire postdocs - ensuring built in supervision mechanism - preference is clearly for PhD students as they are cheaper when it comes to grants - but in order to retain people you need to have more opportunities available for postdocs. ","Athena swan appears to have raised awareness of this issue ","Want to establish my own research group within my school and mentor PhD students. ",,

Similarly, there is, on paper, support to prepare for an academic career, but in reality, most of the support is targetted at guiding you out of academia, applying for non academic job. There is support for funding application, but it is tailored almost exclusively to STEM disciplines. The support does exist on paper, but is wholly inadequate for many ERCs, including myself.","Career development,Careers outside academia,Publishing,Mentoring,Research management,Writing funding proposal,Public engagement/knowledge exchange/media relations,Networking,Leadership,Teaching",,Neutral,"The ones from informal mentors - established academics that I simply got along with well - and other ERCs a few years above me, as the had the most relevant, practical, hands on advice to provide.","My own supervisor.

Find your niche, what makes you stand out compared to others in the same broad field, find the kind of research you like to do, how you like to communicate, in a way that really makes you feel like you are your own researcher, and not trying to fit into a pre-established mold of what I academic should be.","Career development,Careers outside academia,Publishing,Research management,Writing funding proposal,Writing job applications/covering letters/CVs,Job interviewing,Presenting at conferences,Teaching,Time Management",,"Many want to start a family, and end up having to sacrifice their academic career if they want to do so, because early careers are too uncertain. 
There is also still so much sexism and bias that goes unnoticed; administrative tasks and emotional labour that comes up is always sent our way more than our male ECR colleagues. Some sub-fields are still so male dominated that it is very uncomfortable to attend conferences or workshops.","I am still in touch with one of my former student, a young woman who is absolutely brilliant, and I am giving her career advice to the best of my abilities and supporting her any way I can. At the end of the day, that is probably the biggest concrete impact I could ever hope to have, and it is what I was hoping to be in a position of doing one day, when I started my PhD. ","At this point, to me it is less about support, and more about everyone else's awareness. Women can mentor each others, network, get training, etc... but at the end of the day, senior academics, university execs, funding agencies, are the ones that also need to recognize the very real glass ceiling that still exists, the uneven expectations and double standards we face, and actually bake that awareness into their decisions at every level. Supervisors need to be aware of the gender dynamic in their mentoring. Heads of Schools need to realize how much academic emotional labour and academic home keeping ends up falling on women. 
The best support I can get is to make sure I do not need to worry about receiving support, in the long term.","Always talk and share your experience with other - especially other women, but men as well. We do not always recognize sexist behaviours, and getting an outsider's perspective can be very helpful. Moreover, men do not always realize the difficulties we face, and simply talking about it with them, especially other young men ECRs, can help them see some institutional, deeply embedded problems. But we need to talk without be afraid that we complain too much, whine too much, are troublemakers or are not resilient enough for academia.","I want to try to publish my book, and there is a research project I would like to get funding for - but I don't even know where I will find the time to write the funding application, or where to get that funding from. 
I am also thinking more and more about leaving academia, especially in Ireland - I am exhausted and frustrated at how underpaid I am, not being able to afford my own private accomodation, still basically living like an undergraduate when there are other opportunities outside of academia that would value my skills.

The key motivator for my applications was my mentor who was a very talented grant writer. I also had a very strong network of colleagues writing the same grants.,Yes (Specify Below),"At the level of postdoctoral funding the barriers are time as contracts can be relatively short and PIs are under pressure for productivity from grants that postdoctoral fellows are currently on. In addition there is a lack of a clear and consistent funding pathway/pipeline supplied by formerly SFI/IRC and now Research Ireland. 

Beyond postdoctoral funding at more senior levels the major barrier I experience is time. The expectation to teach to the level we are expected and maintain a research career with ""impact"" is unrealistic. One of these career aspects will aways suffer. 

This is made worse by the serious lack of consistent funding opportunities in Ireland. In particular the lack of consistency in the timing of funding calls is detrimental. Grant calls can be announced at any time of year (this changes year on year) with notice of maybe 3 months given. Planning a proposal application is impossible. 3 months notice is not enough time to assemble a well thought out proposal when staff are also teaching. If we are expected to be successful it is critical to apply some consistency to the system of timing of grants. I cannot stress this enough.

This is compounded by the institutions being unwilling or unable to give staff time to write grants. All staff are expected to teach and do research, there is no fair way to redistribute teaching or admin roles should you need to prioritise grant writing. There is no slack in the system allowing for redistribution of hours unless for major grant proposals where sabbaticals can be taken. This can be unfair to colleagues.

Finally, another barrier to applying for funding is research money being allocated to specific centres. If you do not align with a centre or do not have historical connections with PIs in the centre it makes accessing this very lucrative source of funding impossible.

My observations of what this sort of life demands, from at least two institutions in at least two countries, are that there is little care for the wellbeing of students and little consideration for their lives outside of the lab up until the point where they threaten to leave. While the schedules and structure of the work must change as the project develops there are very little safeguards against being overworked. In industry there are clear guidelines which protect the workers in many companies which ultimately protects the company ensuring quality doesn't drop overtime.

My second maternity leave was unpaid, i was out of contract and it was very scary as to when i would return to work and in what capacity. My third maternity leave was limited in terms of pay and i returned to a differnt position. Child care has been challenging, trying to juggle everything. ",No,Support on all fronts,"Career development,Careers outside academia,Mentoring",,"Research is such a challenging career, it can be cut throat, with huge pressures for metrics, and funding. It is unstable, moving from contract to contract. It affects mortgage applications/when to have children. Its not well paid. ",I love being in the lab and doing experiments and the challenges.,"needs to be clear career progression. Telling PhD students that only 8% can stay in acamdemia (or whatever the figure is now) is horrendous. You have a short lifespan as a Post-doc, then you need to fund yourself or leave academia. I have seen so many wonderful scientists especially women leave the industry. Its gut wrenching. they had so much experience and so much to give","I recognise some of the measures brought in to address gender balance have worked (e.g. Research Ireland's gender balance on the SFI IRC Pathways Programme). However by this stage women have often left science. I feel very strongly about this area. Its great having this wonderful 4th level of education but where do all these students go after? It seems like they all need to go to industry. ","For me my career path is no where near what i envisaged when I started my PhD back in 1999. I went into a career in the Research Office, it has evolved certainly and I like what I do now. Its challenging, each day is different. However we are often seem as the failed PI. We all supposedly fell into this career because we couldnt make it as a PI and had done too many post docs. I recognise there are aims to address this and develop research supports and research management as a career path and opportunity. It is another avenue for researchers to go into. We are a very undervalued and unrecognised resource in the Irish research landscape but are crucial part of it. ","I think things have improved significantly for PhD students compared to when i did mine. There are definitely more supports in place, the stipend has increased and from Jan 2025 will be 25k/year. 4 years of hardship is perhaps ok to manage but its after this, perhaps even after that first 2 year post-doc contract that the real issues and challenges emerge. I think this is where the focus needs to be. The government are piling money into PhD programmes but what happens when these people graduate. That is the real issue. this is where science and research is loosing out. We train these students and then they are lost to industry or other sectors. There are too many chiefs and too many students. but not enough qualified experienced scientists in the labs. Why cant you be a hugely successful research scientist and stay in the lab if that is what you would like to do. How much science could be accomplished and at such speed if these people were kept in the lab?? ",ciara.mcmanus1@gmail.com
